<b>Cybersecurity means protecting data, networks, programs and other information from unauthorized or unattended access, destruction or change. In today’s world, cybersecurity is very important because of some security threats and cyber-attacks. For data protection, many companies develop software. This software protects the data. Cybersecurity is important because not only it helps to secure information but also our system from virus attack. After the U.S.A. and China, India has the highest number of internet users.</br> </br>

<b>5 simple tips to help protect your personal data
Since data privacy is such a prevalent issue, many government organizations and corporations spend millions of dollars each year to help protect their data—which could include your PII—from exposure. The average consumer probably doesn’t have that kind of money to spend. But there are inexpensive steps you can take to help protect your data. Here are a few suggestions: <br>

1.At home, use a mail slot or locking mailbox, so that thieves can’t steal your mail. <br>
2.Before discarding, shred documents, including receipts and bank and credit card statements, that contain personal information.<br>
3.Make sure to secure your home Wi-Fi network and other devices so that criminals can’t “eavesdrop” on your online activity.<br>    
 4. Don’t automatically provide your Social Security number just because someone asks for it. Determine if they really need it and, if so, ask how they’ll help protect it.<br>
5.Use strong, unique passwords for all of your online accounts.<br> <br>
One final recommendation to help you keep your data private: Regularly assess the privacy settings on your social media accounts. If you don’t, you may be sharing a lot more than just your name with people you’ve never met—and a savvy criminal could use that information to steal your identity and a lot more.<br> <br> <br>
